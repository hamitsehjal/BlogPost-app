					<h2>About</h2>
					<p>Hi! This is Hamit. In Last Assignment, I couldn't talk about my hobbies and my Interests.Therefore, I used random paragraph
						generator. I did used random paragraph generetor this time also, but first I wanna talk about myself. So, I am currently pursuing Computer Programming
					    and Analysis Advance Diploma at Seneca. I didn't really like web development in my second Semester, but this time I am really enjoying it. I guess it's because, this time it is 
					a lot more hands-on-experience. Whatever it is, I am kinda enjoying this phase. I do like reading books sometimes. I am quite fond of talking to people about their life. I feel thrilled knowing how someone is 
				handling different situations in their lives. And Yeah, I am starting my Co-op next semester. It's Supported Learning Group Leader SDDS Position with Seneca College. I am really excited for this thing.
					</p><p>And here comes random paragraph generator. I hope you enjoy it!!!</p>
					<p>The chair sat in the corner where it had been for over 25 years. The only difference was there
						was someone actually sitting in it. How long had it been since someone had done that? Ten years
						or more he imagined. Yet there was no denying the presence in the chair now.</p>
					<p>My pincher collar is snapped on. Then comes the electric zapper collar. Finally, my purple
						at-home collar is taken off and I know I’m going for a walk to the dog park. I’m so excited to
						see my friends. I hope Spike or Thunder are there already. They're the most fun to chase and
						tumble with. My human is pretty strict with me. I’m only allowed on the grass and not on the
						sidewalks. I think she’s afraid I’m going to jump on the other humans. I don’t understand why
						everyone else gets to jump on the benches and run wild on the sidewalks. They don’t listen to
						their humans. I know I could ignore mine but if I do she may zap me and it’s just not worth it.
						She probably wouldn’t let me back at the dog park if I didn’t listen to her. I just love the dog
						park.</p>
					<p>The towels had been hanging from the rod for years. They were stained and worn, and quite
						frankly, just plain ugly. Debra didn't want to touch them but she really didn't have a choice.
						It was important for her to see what was living within them.
						Benny was tired. Not the normal every day tired from a hard day o work. The exhausted type of
						tired where you're surprised your body can even move. All he wanted to do was sit in front of
						the TV, put his feet up on the coffee table, and drink a beer. The only issue was that he had
						forgotten where he lived.
						He heard the crack echo in the late afternoon about a mile away. His heart started racing and he
						bolted into a full sprint. "It wasn't a gunshot, it wasn't a gunshot," he repeated under his
						breathlessness as he continued to sprint.
						She was in a hurry. Not the standard hurry when you're in a rush to get someplace, but a frantic
						hurry. The type of hurry where a few seconds could mean life or death. She raced down the road
						ignoring speed limits and weaving between cars. She was only a few minutes away when traffic
						came to a dead standstill on the road ahead.</p>
					<p>Time is all relative based on age and experience. When you are a child an hour is a long time to
						wait but a very short time when that’s all the time you are allowed on your iPad. As a teenager
						time goes faster the more deadlines you have and the more you procrastinate. As a young adult,
						you think you have forever to live and don’t appreciate the time you spend with others. As a
						middle-aged adult, time flies by as you watch your children grow up. And finally, as you get old
						and you have fewer responsibilities and fewer demands on you, time slows. You appreciate each
						day and are thankful you are alive. An hour is the same amount of time for everyone yet it can
						feel so different in how it goes by.
						They had made it to Las Vegas, wide-eyed and with so much hope and energy. They had planned the
						trip for more than a year and both were so excited they could barely control themselves. They
						still hadn't realized that Las Vegas promised a place where dreams come true, it was actually
						the place where dreams came to die.
						She had a terrible habit o comparing her life to others. She realized that their life
						experiences were completely different than her own and that she saw only what they wanted her to
						see, but that didn't matter. She still compared herself and yearned for what she thought they
						had and she didn't.</p>

				<p>Her breath exited her mouth in big puffs as if she were smoking a cigarette. The morning dew had made
					her clothes damp and she shivered from the chill in the air. There was only one thing that could get
					her up and out this early in the morning.</p>
